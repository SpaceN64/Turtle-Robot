# Turtle-Robot
A robot made in Turtle (Python 3).

This is for people who are needing help in Python 3 (Im a python 3 coder).

Basics of the code (explained):

import turtle as t - This is importing turtle, but instead of writing something like turtle.forward(90), it is changing the code so you can write t.forward(90) 
instead. This can be used for any import you want, just make sure they are different letters if you have multiple.

t.forward() - moves the turtle forward 
t.right() - moves the turtle right
t.left() - moves the turtle left

t.penup() - stops making a line
t.pendown() - starts making a line again.
